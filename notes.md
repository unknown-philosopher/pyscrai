- ambiguity within many of the entity & relationship components types / attributes. i.e visibility, classified, secret.. etc

- Entity and relationship id's, some ambiguity and confusion possible, especially after being commited to database. 

TODO: 
- batch processing of data files. 

- Add agent interaction modal, which allows the user to interact with the forge agents, allowing for customization of the extraction process, or direct manipulation of existing .json outputs in the /data directory (as well as essentially any of the project files / configurations) This will bring the entire program up to par with the PyScrAI vision. 

- Add a narraritive summary output of the imported data, as well as the ability to modify the harvester agents prompts / create other custom component output schema's, templates, etc. 

- Add the ability to assign different llm_model_provider profiles to different entities in the same simulation (harness local models for 'smaller' scale actors or quick actions, and large cloud models for orchestrators / large polities etc)
