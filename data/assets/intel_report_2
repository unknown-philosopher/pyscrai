DATE: 2026-02-14
PRECEDENCE: FLASH (Priority 01)
ZONE: SECTOR 12 (GAMMA RENDER)
REPORT ID: SIG-22904-B

SUBJECT: COORDINATED PENETRATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE NETWORK (VOID-POINT OPS)

(S//NF) INITIAL SUMMARY:
SIGINT intercepts from unauthorized mesh-networks (ref: "Ghost Net") indicate a developing operational nexus between the Shadow Collective (non-state hostile actor) and compromised elements within the Sector 12 Magistracy. Intercepts confirm a scheduled contact at location "VOID-POINT" (Grid: 42.103, -71.402). Participants identified as a Magistracy High Councilor and a Collective liaison designated "WRAITH."

(S//OC) SUBJECT TRACKING - VALERIUS THORNE:

0400Z: Valerius Thorne (Councilor, Magistracy) observed exiting the Spire of Order administrative hub.

CARGO: Thorne is confirmed in possession of the "Obsidian Key" (Hardware Security Module, Asset ID: HSM-2.5M).

ASSESSMENT: While Thorne remains officially "ACTIVE" within Magistracy rolls, internal Sentinel heuristics (Reliability Rating: F3) project a 65% treason probability. Subject is considered a high-value defection risk.

(S//NF) ASSET IDENTIFICATION - JULIAN VANE:

0430Z: Encrypted burst transmission localized to a mobile relay. Metadata links signal to Julian Vane (Alias: "THE MIME").

STATUS: Vane is a primary sub-contractor for the Iron Syndicate, currently embedded with the Shadow Collective for Phase Zero preparations.

LOCATION: Vane has been visually confirmed at the Black Swan Cantina (Zone 12, Sub-Level 4).

(S//OC) LIAISON ARRIVAL - SARAH KAEL:

0615Z: Individual identified as "WRAITH" arrived at the Void-Point. Biometric reconciliation suggests high-confidence match with Sarah Kael (Former Agent, Status: BURNED - ref: 2024 Zurich Breach).

CARGO: Kael is reported carrying a prototype "GHOST-CLOAK" (Optical Camouflage Unit).

RELATIONSHIP: Subject appears to have been fully integrated into the Collective’s internal security tier.

(C//NF) COLLATERAL FRICTION POINTS:
Julian Vane (THE MIME) is currently subject to a 50,000 Credit extraction bounty issued by the Iron Syndicate (ref: "Unauthorized Data Leakage"). This bounty constitutes a significant friction point in the Syndicate-Collective non-aggression pact, as the Collective is currently shielding Vane for active operations.
