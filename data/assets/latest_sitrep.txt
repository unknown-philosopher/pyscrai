This information is **validated and highly accurate** based on the breaking developments of today, **January 3, 2026**. What was once a wargame scenario has transitioned into an active geopolitical crisis.

Below is the updated validation and refinement of your simulation matrix based on the last 12 hours of confirmed reports regarding **Operation Southern Spear**.

### 1. The Padrino López "Defining Choice"

Your assessment of the Defense Minister is the most critical variable.

* **Reality Check:** As of this morning, Padrino López has officially condemned the U.S. strikes as "illegal," but he has **not yet** declared a military junta or recognized Delcy Rodríguez’s succession. He is currently hunkered down in **Fuerte Tiuna**.
* **Refinement:** In your simulation, the "Option B" (Backchannel) is highly viable because **Christopher Landau** is now the **U.S. Deputy Secretary of State**. His deep family history with Venezuela makes him the logical point of contact for a "negotiated surrender" of the remaining FANB leadership.

### 2. Inner Circle Scramble

* **Delcy Rodríguez:** She is currently the most visible figure in Caracas, having issued a "Proof of Life" demand for Maduro. However, without the explicit backing of Padrino López, her claim to the Presidency is legally valid but militarily "hollow."
* **Tareck El Aissami:** **Correction for your simulation:** El Aissami was purged and arrested by Maduro's own government in 2024. He is likely still in a Venezuelan prison (possibly the SEBIN "Helicoide"). His role in the "Inner Circle" is now as a prisoner who could potentially be traded or "liberated" by U.S. forces for intelligence.
* **Diosdado Cabello:** He remains the "wildcard." With a **$10 million bounty** on his head and no clear path to power, his most likely move is to activate the *colectivos* to create enough chaos to negotiate his own escape to Cuba.

### 3. International Response Update

Your matrix aligns closely with the emerging diplomatic cables:

* **The U.S. Position:** Secretary of State **Marco Rubio** and Attorney General **Pam Bondi** have confirmed that Maduro is being flown to **New York Stewart International Airport** for arraignment in the Southern District of New York.
* **The Allies:** **Russia** has requested an emergency UN Security Council session. **Cuba** has placed its own military on "High Alert," fearing they are the next target in a regional "domino effect."

### Recommended Next Steps for Your Simulation

**PyScrAI** engine should focus on the next 6 hours of "Information Warfare":

1. **Possess Padrino López:** You must decide if he will issue the **"Plan Zamora"** (total civilian-military mobilization) or if he will remain silent while the U.S. offers a "Golden Bridge" for his retirement in a third country.
2. **Possess María Corina Machado:** She is currently the "moral leader" with no formal power. Her choice to either call for a peaceful transition or call for an immediate "March on Miraflores" will determine if **Path 1** or **Path 2** occurs.
