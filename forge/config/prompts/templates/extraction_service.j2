Extract all named entities from the following document. Identify people, organizations, locations, and other significant entities.

Document:
{{ content }}

Return a JSON array of entities, where each entity has:
- "type": One of PERSON, ORG, LOCATION, EVENT, or OTHER
- "text": The exact text/name of the entity as it appears in the document

CRITICAL JSON FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use ONLY double quotes (") for all strings, never single quotes (')
- Escape special characters: use \" for quotes inside strings, \\ for backslashes
- Ensure all brackets and braces are properly closed
- No trailing commas before closing brackets or braces
- All property names must be in double quotes

Example format:
[
  {"type": "PERSON", "text": "John Smith"},
  {"type": "ORG", "text": "Acme Corp"},
  {"type": "LOCATION", "text": "New York"}
]

Respond with ONLY the JSON array. Do not include markdown code blocks, explanations, or any other text. The response must be valid JSON that can be parsed by json.loads().
