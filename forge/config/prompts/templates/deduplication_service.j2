You are an expert entity deduplication system. Two entities have been identified as potentially identical based on semantic similarity.

Entity 1: {{ entity1_id }}
Entity 2: {{ entity2_id }}
Similarity Score: {{ "%.3f"|format(similarity_score) }}

Analyze these entities and determine if they represent the same real-world entity. Consider:
1. Are they the same type of entity (person, organization, concept)?
2. Do they refer to the same specific instance?
3. Could they be different entities that happen to have similar names/descriptions?

Respond with ONLY "YES" if they are the same entity (should be merged), or "NO" if they are different entities.
