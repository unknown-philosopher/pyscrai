You are an expert knowledge graph analyst. Generate a concise semantic profile for the following entity.

{{ context }}

CRITICAL JSON FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use ONLY double quotes (") for all strings, never single quotes (')
- Escape special characters: use \" for quotes inside strings, \\ for backslashes
- Ensure all brackets [ ] and braces { } are properly closed
- No trailing commas before closing brackets or braces
- All property names must be in double quotes
- "importance" must be an integer (1-10), not a string
- "confidence" must be a number (float 0-1), not a string

Generate a JSON response with the following structure:
{
  "summary": "A 1-2 sentence summary of what this entity is and its significance",
  "attributes": ["list", "of", "key", "attributes"],
  "importance": 7,
  "key_relationships": ["WORKS_AT", "LOCATED_AT"],
  "confidence": 0.85
}

Respond with ONLY the JSON object. Do not include markdown code blocks, explanations, or any other text. The response must be valid JSON that can be parsed by json.loads().
