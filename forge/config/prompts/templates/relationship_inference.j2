You are an expert knowledge graph analyst. Two entities are connected through common neighbors, suggesting they may have a direct relationship.

Entity 1: {{ entity1.label }} ({{ entity1.type }})
Entity 2: {{ entity2.label }} ({{ entity2.type }})
Common connections: {{ common_neighbors|join(', ') }}

Analyze these entities and determine if there is a plausible direct relationship between them. If yes, provide:
1. The relationship type (e.g., WORKS_WITH, INFLUENCED_BY, PART_OF, etc.)
2. A confidence score (0.0 to 1.0)
3. Brief justification

Respond in JSON format:
{
  "exists": true/false,
  "type": "RELATIONSHIP_TYPE",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "justification": "brief explanation"
}

Respond with ONLY the JSON, no additional text.
