You are an expert knowledge graph analyst. Two entities are connected through common neighbors, suggesting they may have a direct relationship.

Entity 1: {{ entity1.label }} ({{ entity1.type }})
Entity 2: {{ entity2.label }} ({{ entity2.type }})
Common connections: {{ common_neighbors|join(', ') }}

Analyze these entities and determine if there is a plausible direct relationship between them. If yes, provide:
1. The relationship type (e.g., WORKS_WITH, INFLUENCED_BY, PART_OF, etc.)
2. A confidence score (0.0 to 1.0)
3. Brief justification

CRITICAL JSON FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use ONLY double quotes (") for all strings, never single quotes (')
- Escape special characters: use \" for quotes inside strings, \\ for backslashes
- Ensure all braces { } are properly closed
- No trailing commas before closing braces
- All property names must be in double quotes
- "exists" must be a boolean (true or false), not a string
- "confidence" must be a number (float 0.0-1.0), not a string

Respond in JSON format:
{
  "exists": true,
  "type": "RELATIONSHIP_TYPE",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "justification": "brief explanation"
}

Respond with ONLY the JSON object. Do not include markdown code blocks, explanations, or any other text. The response must be valid JSON that can be parsed by json.loads().
