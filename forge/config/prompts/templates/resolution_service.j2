Analyze the following document and extract relationships between the entities listed below.

Document:
{{ document_content }}

Extracted Entities:
{% for entity in entities -%}
- {{ entity.text }} ({{ entity.type }})
{% endfor %}

Extract ALL relationships that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied in the document. For each relationship, provide:
- source: The source entity name (exactly as listed above)
- target: The target entity name (exactly as listed above)
- type: The relationship type. Use specific types such as:
  * WORKS_AT / MEMBER_OF / PART_OF (for organizational membership)
  * LOCATED_AT / OPERATED_AT / BASED_AT (for location relationships)
  * RECEIVED_FROM / TRANSFERRED_TO / SENT_TO (for transactions)
  * COMMANDED_BY / REPORTS_TO / UNDER (for hierarchy)
  * ASSOCIATED_WITH / RELATED_TO (for general associations)
  * STATUS / CONDITION (for states like "under siege")
- confidence: A confidence score from 0.0 to 1.0 based on how explicit the relationship is in the text
  * 0.9-1.0: Explicitly stated (e.g., "of the", "within the", "at")
  * 0.7-0.89: Strongly implied from context
  * 0.5-0.69: Weakly implied
  * Below 0.5: Do not include

IMPORTANT:
- Only extract relationships that are actually mentioned or clearly implied in the document
- Do NOT create relationships just because entities appear together
- Use the exact entity names as they appear in the entity list above
- If an entity has multiple names/aliases, use the primary name from the entity list

Return a JSON array of relationships:
[
  {
    "source": "Entity Name",
    "target": "Entity Name",
    "type": "RELATIONSHIP_TYPE",
    "confidence": 0.85
  }
]

Respond with ONLY the JSON array, no additional text or explanation.
